# Seattle_AirBnB_GeospatialAnalysis
This project explores Airbnb listings in Seattle, Washington, using data analysis techniques in Python. The main goal is to determine the key factors influencing the price of Airbnb listings, with a focus on the location of the listings.

The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), geospatial analysis, and investigation of factors such as neighborhood safety and proximity to landmarks. Visualizations and statistical analysis are used to uncover insights into the relationship between listing attributes and prices.

The project also investigates the correlation between neighborhood safety ratings and listing prices, as well as the impact of proximity to landmarks and water bodies on listing prices.

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks documenting the analysis process, along with the dataset used and any relevant scripts or visualizations.
